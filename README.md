# Vext-MapEditor
A realtime map editor for Venice Unleashed

Controls:

F2 to enable mouse
F3 to disable mouse
Q to translate
W to rotate
E to scale
First list are the blueprints (click on it an an object will spawn where you are looking)
Second list are the spawned objects, click on it to select it and see its controls
Spawning some object crash the client so be careful
To save the changes click on serialize button and copy the stuff on the text box, and to load it paste that text on JSONentities.lua
